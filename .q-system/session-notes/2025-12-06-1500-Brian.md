# Session Notes: 2025-12-06-1500-Brian

**Summary:** Implemented 0.5-second auto-hide tooltip for sidebar icons on mobile, reduced post composer size, made all right panes consistent at 315px width, and restored lost user profiles/clickable usernames from a previous commit after git history investigation.

## Key Accomplishments

- Fixed sidebar tooltip to show for 0.5 seconds then disappear on icon click (mobile view)
- Reduced "Post here" textarea to be more compact (font 15px, height 18px)
- Made all right panes consistent width at 315px (was 350px)
- Diagnosed and fixed missing user profiles issue via git history
- Restored 5 missing files from commit f89811f:
  - src/data/users.js (28 community user profiles)
  - src/components/UserProfile.js
  - src/components/CourseDetailView.js
  - src/components/Settings.js
  - src/components/Settings.css
- Restored clickable usernames and course links in Community
- Deployed working version to GitHub Pages

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 0.5 second tooltip display | User tested 5s, 2s, 1s - settled on 0.5s as optimal |
| 315px right pane width | 10% reduction from 350px for more content space |
| Use git checkout to restore files | Files were deleted in later commits, needed recovery from f89811f |
