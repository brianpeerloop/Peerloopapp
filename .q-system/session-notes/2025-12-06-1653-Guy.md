# Session Notes: 2025-12-06-1653-Guy

**Summary:** Continued building the Creator Dashboard with top navigation bar, redesigned Action Required and Upcoming Sessions sections to Twitter-style layouts, and optimized Key Metrics to be more compact. Also carried forward prior work on Browse state persistence and UI fixes.

## Key Accomplishments

- Added top navigation bar to Creator Dashboard with tabs (Overview, Students, Certifications, Payouts, etc.) and notification badges
- Redesigned Action Required section from boxed cards to clean Twitter-style text listings
- Moved "Review →" links to right side of title line for better layout
- Made Key Metrics cards much smaller (18px values, 10px padding) so all 5 fit in one row
- Redesigned Today's Sessions to Twitter-style layout matching Action Required
- Renamed section to "Upcoming Sessions"
- Updated sessions to show full date and time (e.g., "Dec 6, 2024 · 10:00 AM")
