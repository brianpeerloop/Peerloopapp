## Session Work

### Morning - Session Start
- Used q-begin to start session with context refresh
- Reviewed last session notes from December 3, 2025
- Noted pending work: dark/light mode, course listing cleanup

### Shell Troubleshooting
- Encountered Windows PowerShell shell output issues
- Deleted Cursor workspace terminal files to reset
- Shell commands execute but output not captured (workaround: read terminal files directly)

### Sidebar Tooltip Fix
- User reported tooltip labels staying visible on mobile icon click
- Implemented auto-hide timer using React useState + useRef
- Iterated through durations: 5s → 2s → 1s → 0.5s
- Final: 0.5 second display with fade transition

### UI Adjustments
- Reduced "Post here" textarea size (font 15px, padding 2px, height 18px)
- Reduced right pane width from 350px to 315px (~10% reduction)
- Applied consistent width to both Community.css and MainContent.css

### Git & User Profiles Crisis
- User noticed missing user profiles feature
- Investigation revealed commit f89811f had the feature
- Files were deleted in subsequent commits
- Used `git checkout f89811f -- [files]` to restore:
  - src/data/users.js (28 user profiles)
  - src/components/UserProfile.js
  - src/components/CourseDetailView.js
  - src/components/Settings.js/.css
  - src/components/Community.js
  - src/components/MainContent.js

### Deployment
- Committed restored files to GitHub
- Deployed to GitHub Pages with `npm run deploy`
- Verified user profile clicks working locally and on GitHub Pages

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 0.5s tooltip duration | Best UX after testing multiple durations |
| 315px right pane width | 10% reduction gives more content space |
| Restore from git history | Files accidentally deleted, needed recovery |
| Full file restore vs merge | Simpler to restore entire files than merge changes |
