### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove Browse right pane | User requested cleaner Browse layout without Trending/Who to Follow |
| Expand center to 885px | Take ~half of removed right pane width (250px/2 = 125px + 760px) |
| Keep 1400px sidebar breakpoint | User preferred to keep original responsive behavior |
| Use node script for database edit | Avoided file sync issues with hot reloading |
