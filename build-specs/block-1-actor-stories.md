**Version:** 1.1 (Corrected)
**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Original Author:** Gabriel Rymberg (with Claude)

**Status:** APPROVED
**Source:** Synthesized from Brian's MVP decisions (Dec 2-6, 2025)

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes **what each type of person can DO** with PeerLoop in Block 1. It is organized by **actor** (human user), not by feature.

**Why actor stories?**
- Features tell us what we BUILD
- Actor stories tell us what people can DO
- This informs which features must work together for each actor to complete their tasks
- It helps us validate: "Can we put this person in front of the system and let them do their job?"

---

## The Four Actors

| Actor | Example | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Student** | Sarah | Pays for course, learns from Student-Teacher |
| **Student-Teacher** | Marcus | Certified former student who now teaches others |
| **Creator** | Guy | Expert who created the course content, manages their course |
| **Platform Owner** | Brian | Runs PeerLoop, handles platform-level operations |

---

## How to Read This Document

For each actor, you'll see:

1. **Context** - Who is this person?
2. **What they CAN do** - Capabilities in Block 1
3. **What they CANNOT do** - Explicitly out of scope for Block 1
4. **Dependencies** - What must work for this actor to succeed

At the end:
- Summary of automated vs manual operations
- Open questions for discussion

---

## What Guy CANNOT Do in Block 1

| Capability | Why Not | Workaround |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Edit course content in system | Course editor is Block 3 | Ask Brian to update links |
| Upload new content | No upload feature | Provide links to Brian |
| Message students directly | Messaging not built | Use email or Discord |
| See advanced analytics | Full analytics is Block 3 | Basic stats available |

---

## Key Insight: Block 1 Creator Dashboard is ACTIVE

In Block 1, Guy can **monitor AND act** through the system:
- ✅ Approve certifications
- ✅ Approve payouts
- ✅ Approve Student-Teacher applications

This is different from earlier assumptions. Creator manages their course operations.

---

## Dependencies for Creator Success

| Step | Features Required |
|------|-------------------|
| Log in | User auth |
| See stats | Creator dashboard with metrics |
| See students | Student list with progress |
| See S-Ts | Student-Teacher list |
| See sessions | Session display |
| Approve certifications | Certification workflow UI |
| Approve payouts | Payout approval UI + Stripe integration |
| Approve S-T applications | S-T approval workflow UI |

# Actor 4: PLATFORM OWNER (Brian)

## Context

**Who:** Brian LeBlanc, Founder & CEO
**Role:** Runs PeerLoop platform
**Block 1 Reality:** Strategic oversight, platform-level operations only

---

## What Brian CAN Do in Block 1

### 4.1 Onboard Creators (Manual Process)

Brian can:

- Meet with potential creators
- Evaluate their courses and credentials
- Decide who to bring onto the platform
- Collect their course content:
  - Course title and description
  - Module structure
  - Video links (YouTube/Vimeo)
  - Document links (Google Drive)
  - Pricing
- Set up the course in the system (directly in database/backend)
- Create their Creator account
- Walk them through the Creator Dashboard

**Process flow:**

```
Creator applies → Brian evaluates → Brian decides →
Brian collects content → Brian sets up in system →
Creator gets login → Creator manages their course
```

---

### 4.2 Monitor Platform Health

Brian can:

- Log in with admin access to see all courses
- View Creator dashboards for each course
- See enrollments, progress, sessions across platform
- Access Stripe dashboard directly for:
  - Payment monitoring
  - Transaction history
  - Revenue tracking

---

### 4.3 Handle Platform-Level Exceptions

Brian handles:

- Refund requests (decides case-by-case, processes through Stripe)
- Technical issues (troubleshoots or escalates)
- Disputes that Creators can't resolve
- Any edge cases not covered by Creator authority

---

### 4.4 Creator Support

Brian provides:

- Check-ins with Creators (1-2 hrs/week)
- Answers Creator questions
- Helps resolve issues escalated from Creators

---

## What Brian Does NOT Do in Block 1

| Task | Who Does It |
|------|-------------|
| Approve certifications | Creator |
| Approve payouts | Creator |
| Approve S-T applications | Creator |
| Day-to-day course operations | Creator |
| Track individual student progress | Creator |

---

## What Brian Has Access To

| System | Access |
|--------|--------|
| PeerLoop (as admin) | Can view all Creator dashboards |
| Stripe Dashboard | Direct access for payments, refunds |
| Database | Direct access for setup and edge cases |
| Email | For creator communications |

---

## Brian's Weekly Time Commitment (Estimated)

For 60-80 students across 4-5 creators:

| Task | Hours/Week |
|------|------------|
| Creator check-ins | 1-2 hrs |
| Exception handling | 1-2 hrs |
| Platform monitoring | 30 min |
| **Total** | **~3-4 hrs/week** |

**Note:** This is manageable because Creators handle their own course operations (certifications, payouts, S-T approvals).

---

# Open Questions (Reduced List)

1. **Certification Format:** What does the certificate look like? PDF? Email? Badge?

2. **Communication Channels:** How do S-T and Creator communicate? Email? Discord?

3. **Cancellation/Rescheduling:** How do students cancel or reschedule? Contact S-T directly?

4. **S-T Assignment:** Is a student permanently assigned to one S-T, or can they switch?

5. **Payout Timing:** When does Creator approve payouts? After each completion? Weekly batch?

6. **Content Updates:** How does Creator request content changes? Contact Brian?

7. **Progress Verification:** Students self-report progress. Is there any verification?

---

# What This Document Enables

With these actor stories, we can:

1. **Validate Block 1 scope** - Do we have everything each actor needs?
2. **Identify feature dependencies** - Which features must work together?
3. **Plan testing** - Put each actor type in front of the system
4. **Clarify responsibilities** - Creator manages course, Brian manages platform
5. **Prepare training** - What does each actor need to learn?

---

# Next Steps

1. Brian reviews and approves this document ✅
2. Share with Fraser for technical validation
3. Map actor stories to specific features from feature blocks
4. Use as basis for Block 1 development priorities

---
