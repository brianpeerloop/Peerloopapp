# PeerLoop Business Model Summary

## The Core Concept

Peer-to-peer tutoring marketplace where students who complete a course can become paid teachers of that same course.

## The Flywheel

```
Expert creates course → teaches Student A
Student A completes → becomes Student-Teacher
Student-Teacher teaches Student B → earns 70% of tuition
Student B completes → becomes Student-Teacher
→ Repeat infinitely 🔄
```

## Revenue Split (Per Course Sale)

| Recipient | % | Example ($500 course) |
|-----------|---|----------------------|
| Student-Teacher | 70% | $350 |
| Creator (expert) | 15% | $75 |
| PeerLoop (platform) | 15% | $75 |

## Why It Works

- **Solves Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem:** 1-on-1 tutoring is proven 2x more effective than classroom, but too expensive at scale
- **PeerLoop makes it affordable:** Peer teachers work cheaper than experts, students earn while they learn
- **Price Point:** $300-600 per course (tutoring prices, not MOOC prices)

## MVP Scale

- 60-80 students
- 4-5 course creators
- Target: 10%+ of students become Student-Teachers
